	    <h3>HTML</h3>
		<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.HTML describes the structure of a Web page.
		 HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.
		 The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>
	    <h3>History</h3>
		<h4>Development</h4>
		<p>The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993.There have been many different versions of HTML.
		 Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML.
		 It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering 
		 Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, 
		 the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, 
		 which included an SGML Document type definition to define the grammar.[9][10] The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.</p>
